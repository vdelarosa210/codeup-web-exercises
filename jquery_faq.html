<h1>10 National Park FAQs</h1>
<dl>
    <dt>What facilities or services does Park offer?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Aside from the visitor center and bathrooms, there are no facilities in Arches. Gas, groceries, lodging and other amenities are available in Moab.</dd>
    <dt>When is the visitor center open?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">The visitor center is open daily at least from 9 am to 4 pm, (except December 25), with extended hours spring through fall.</dd>
    <dt>Do you accept checks?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yes. We take personal, business, and travelers checks for entrance fees and tour fees. We accept travelers checks for bookstore purchases. All checks must be drawn in US dollars from a US bank. Personal checks $50 and over must include a social security number. Business checks $50 and over must include a tax ID number.</dd>
    <dt>Do you accept credit cards or debit cards?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yes. We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express for entrance fees and tour fees. You may use your Visa, MasterCard, and Discover for bookstore purchases.</dd>
    <dt>Can I get information mailed to me?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yes. Contact us to request mailed information. You can save our printing costs by downloading brochures and newspapers from the website. Print them at home, and bring them with you to the park.</dd>
    <dt>Where can I get extra brochures?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Canyonlands Natural History Association operates the bookstore in our visitor center and sells the official Arches National Park brochure that is handed out at the entrance station.</dd>
    <dt>Where can I buy an item I saw in your visitor center?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Canyonlands Natural History Association operates the bookstores in our visitor centers.</dd>
    <dt>Does the park close at night?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">No. The park never closes.</dd>
    <dt>Can I get an entrance fee waiver?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yes. If you are an educational group whose visit is educational rather than recreational, you can apply for an entrance fee waiver.</dd>
    <dt>Will my cell phone work in the Park?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Maybe. You may find limited coverage in some areas of the park. In other areas, coverage is poor to nonexistent. Do not count on being able to receive service.</dd>
